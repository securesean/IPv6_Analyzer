## Description
This is a silly program to help me codify IPv6 knowledge.

##Features
- Tells you about the IPv6 address given
- Translates IPv6 addresses in GPG Keywords and Bitcoin seed words
- If a Unicast address is detected where we have a 64 bit EUI, this will display the would-be MAC address and org info
